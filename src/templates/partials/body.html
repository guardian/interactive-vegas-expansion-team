            <p><span class='uit-drop'><span class='uit-drop__inner'>U</span></span>ntil recently, Las Vegas was the largest US city to lack a major sports franchise. That was until late last year when the Golden Knights, the NHL's first expansion team in 17 years, broke ice in the desert.</p>

            <p>It's fair to say that the Golden Knights were viewed as a novelty rather than a team that was meant to instantly contend for silverware. After all, the early years for expansion teams tend to follow a normal pattern. An expansion draft produces a rag-tag group of misfits who go on to tank in their inaugural season, gaining their franchise prize draft picks for future seasons. The Golden Knights, however, aren't normal. They won their first game against the Dallas Stars back in October and haven't looked back since.</p>

            <h3 class='uit-subhead'>
                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>How does the Knights inaugural season compare to other NHL expansion teams?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Historically, NHL expansion teams struggle in their first season and more often than not finish bottom of their conference. The only exceptions are the expansion teams of 1967 who were all placed into their own additional Western conference. This guaranteed that one team, St.Louis Blues, would make it to the final. They were unsurprisingly were swept 4 games to 0.</p>

            <p>The Knights, however, are different. Their incredible form (51-24-7) saw them record the best inaugural regular season of any NHL expansion team in history. Their rookie winning percentage was 23 percentage points better than the previous best, the Anaheim Ducks.</p>

            </div>

            <p>On top of this impressive record, the Knights are the only true expansion team to make the NHL playoffs in their inaugural season. They even made it look easy by winning the Pacific Division in order to get there. Each step after that was viewed as a remarkable achievement. They beat the Kings, the Sharks and finally the Jets to reach the Stanley Cup final, making an already historical season the stuff of dreams.</p>

            <p>To put this in context, their odds of winning the championship this year were 500-1. Further more, there are four NHL sides who have never reached the Stanley Cup finals, despite trying for a combined 89 seasons.</p>

            <p>Within their league the Knights come out helmet and shoulder plates above their associates. However, their story isn’t limited to the ice. Compared to the best starters from other major US sports leagues their story becomes even more remarkable.</p>

            <p>Like the NHL's history of expansion teams, all new sides brought into NFL, NBA and MLB have failed to make the playoffs in their first season.</p>

            <h3 class='uit-subhead'>
                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>So the Knights are unique across major US sports then?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Almost. New expansion teams from the major four US sports might initially struggle but in MLS it's a different story.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fire, Houston Dynamo, Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United all achieved instant success by reaching the playoffs in their first seasons in MLS. Fire and Dynamo actually went further and brought home MLS Cup in their inaugural season (Dynamo won the title in their second season too). However, this isn't exactly a like-for-like comparison.</p>

            <p>While MLS does have a similar process of inducting new teams into their league, there is one telling difference: the importance of expansion drafts. Let's take the most recent MLS success story, Atlanta United. They drafted five players in their expansion draft, three of whom were instantly traded while the other two are now on loan at lower-level clubs.</p>

            <p>The simple reason is that MLS clubs have a huge global talent pool at their disposal. The best soccer players tend to ply their trade in Europe and South America. Top players can be signed freely in less regulated foreign transfer markets. As for NHL, and the other major US sports, the best players are already there. Not only does this make MLS an unfair comparison, it also makes the Knights success even more impressive. They had to feed on the scraps left by the established teams.</p>

            <h3 class='uit-subhead'>
                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>How common is instant success among expansion teams?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Outside of MLS, reaching the playoffs for an expansion team is a pipe dream, so the Knights are on (UPDATE) verge of making unprecedented and unexpected history. However, should it all go wrong against their Stanley Cup opponents, Tampa Bay Lightning, all is not lost. If they can come back stronger and prove this team is built for success, reaching the heights of a sport early on in a franchise's history isn't impossible.</p>

A few seasons later, Kareem left and the Bucks have since struggled to meet the highs of those early years.</p>

                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>Are they built for success though?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>The Golden Knights have already been incredibly successful whatever happens next. Their team, cobbled together from unprotected draft picks, have massively overachieved.</p>

            <p>They have a reliable goalie, albeit an aging one, in three-time Stanley Cup champion Marc-André Fleury. They also have a plethora of ex-fringe players, like Deryk Engelland and William Karlsson, who were picked up in the expansion draft and have posted career-best numbers.</p>

            <p>Is this all sustainable? Who knows, the Knights are the only franchise in US sports history to be asked such a question in their first season. The only thing that's clear is that for Las Vegas, the long wait for a team to call its own has been more than worth it, for this season at least.</p>
