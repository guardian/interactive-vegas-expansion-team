The NHL’s first expansion team since 2000 were already an intriguing story before a single face-off.</p>

            <p>The sports-starved city had been never gotten this close to a major sports team after broken promises of MLB and NBA sides. The closest they had gotten before was in 1983 when the Utah Jazz and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came to town in an 11-game experiment, or cash grab if you’re feeling cynical.</p>

            <p>Since then Las Vegas has remained one of the largest cities in the United States to lack a major sports team. That was until this NHL season when the Golden Knights broke ice in the desert. They won their first game against the Dallas Stars and to everyone’s surprise kept winning. Record after record for an expansion team fell. Vegas waited too long for a Big Four sport to not hit the ground running.</p>

                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>How does the Knights inaugural season compare to other NHL expansion teams?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Historically, NHL expansion teams struggle in their first season and more often than not place bottom in their conference. The only exceptions are the expansion teams of 1967 when the league added an additional conference. Guaranteeing that four of the six new teams would achieve a play-off berth and that one would make it to the final.</p>

            <p>The Knights, however, weren't promised anything. Making them not only unique in clinching a playoff spot in their inaugural season, their main season record is the best of any expansion team. The previous best of any non-1967 side came via Disney magic as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim respectably won 39% of games.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>Almost. Other expansion teams from the Big Four might struggle, when compared to the Knights, but in MLS it's a different story.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fire, Houston Dynamo, Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United all achieved instant success by reaching the playoffs in their first seasons as clubs. Fire and Dynamo actually went further and brought home the MLS Cup in their inaugural season. NHL does, however, have more in common with NBA, NFL and MLB than it does to MLS. So this isn't exactly a like-for-like comparison.</p>

            <p>While MLS does have traditional expansion drafts, they're not as important to a franchises success. Let's take the most recent MLS success story in Atlanta United. They drafted five players in their expansion draft, three of which were instantly traded and the other two are now on loan at minor league soccer clubs.</p>

            <p>The simple reason is that MLS clubs have a global talent pool at their disposal. The best soccer players tend to ply their trade in Europe and South America. These players can be signed freely in less regulated foreign transfer markets. Meanwhile the best hockey players are already in the NHL. Not only does this make MLS an unfair comparison, it also makes the Knights success even better. They had to fend on the scraps of the established boys.</p>

            <h3 class='uit-subhead'>
                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>Is this a fluke or are they setup for success?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Well this is the $XX dollar question. Are the Golden Knights just a golden flash in the pan or are they headed for an instant dynasty? Hockey is a sport where a strong goalie can be make or break. Three time Stanley Cup champion Marc-André Fleury has been a rock at the back for the Golden Knights with an impressive .927 save percentage. However, at 33, he's already one of the NHL's more senior goalies.</p>
