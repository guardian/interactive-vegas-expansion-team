The NHL’s first expansion team since 2000 were already an intriguing story before a single face-off.</p>

            <p>The sports-starved city had been never gotten this close to a major sports team after broken promises of MLB and NBA sides. The closest they had gotten before was in 1983 when the Utah Jazz and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came to town in an 11-game experiment, or cash grab if you’re feeling cynical.</p>

            <p>Since then Las Vegas has remained one of the largest cities in the United States to lack a major sports team. That was until this NHL season when the Golden Knights broke ice in the desert.  They won their first game against the Dallas Stars and to everyone’s surprise kept winning. Record after record for an expansion team fell. Vegas waited too long for a Big Four sport to not hit the ground running.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>Honestly, it's not even close. Historically, NHL expansion teams struggle in their first season and more often than not place bottom in their conference. Not only are they unique in making the playoffs in their inaugural season, their main season record is the best of any expansion team. The previous record required a little touch of Disney magic as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim respectably won 39% of games.</p>
