Decades of promises, that included plans of bring MLB and NBA teams to the area, ended up being broken continuing to leave Vegas a sports-starved city. That was until late last year when the Golden Knights, the NHL's first expansion team in 17 years, broke ice in the desert.</p>

            <p>It's fair to say that the Golden Knights were being viewed as more of a long awaited experiment than a team that was meant to instantly contend for silverware. However, they won their first game against the Dallas Stars back in October and haven't looked back. Vegas had waited too long for this franchise to wait any longer for success.</p>

                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>How does the Knights inaugural season compare to other NHL expansion teams?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Historically, NHL expansion teams struggle in their first season and more often than not place bottom in their conference. The only exceptions are the expansion teams of 1967 who were all placed into their own additional Western conference. Guaranteeing at least a few of them would perform well by default against their equally lackluster in-conference competition.</p>

            <p>The Knights, however, weren't promised anything. Yet their incredible regular season form (51-24-7) has seen them record the best inaugural regular season of any NHL expansion team. The previous best were a whopping 23% off the Knights' pace, as no amount of Disney magic could help the Mighty Ducks in their first season.</p>

            <p>On top of this impressive record, the Knights are unique in being the only true expansion team to make the NHL playoffs in their inaugural season. They even made it look easy by winning the Pacific Division in order to get there. This was then followed up by a clean sweep of the Kings and a tighter 4-2 series win over the San Jose Sharks to make it to the conference final.

                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>So the Knights are unique across major US sports then?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Almost. New expansion teams from the major four US sports might initially struggle but in MLS it's a different story.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fire, Houston Dynamo, Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United all achieved instant success by reaching the playoffs in their first seasons as clubs. Fire and Dynamo actually went further and brought home the MLS Cup in their inaugural season. However, this isn't exactly a like-for-like comparison.</p>

            <p>While MLS does have a similar process of inducting new teams into their league, there is one telling difference: the importance of expansion drafts. Let's take the most recent MLS success story in Atlanta United. They drafted five players in their expansion draft, three of which were instantly traded and the other two are now on loan at minor league soccer clubs.</p>

            <p>The simple reason is that MLS clubs have a humongous global talent pool at their disposal. The best soccer players tend to ply their trade in Europe and South America. Top players can be signed freely in less regulated foreign transfer markets. As for NHL, and the other major US sports, the best players are already there. Not only does this make MLS an unfair comparison, it also makes the Knights success even better. They had to fend on the scraps of the established boys.</p>

            <h3 class='uit-subhead'>
                <span class='uit-subhead__inner'>How common is instant success among expansion teams?</span>
            </h3>

            <p>Outside of MLS, reaching the playoffs for an expansion team is a pipe dream, so the Knights are on (UPDATE) verge of making unprecedented and unexpected history. However, should it all go wrong against XXXXXX PROBABLY CAPTIALS THO, all is not lost. If they can come back stronger and prove this team is built for success, reaching the heights of a sport early on in a franchise's history isn't impossible.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>Let's be fair, the Vegas Golden Knights have already been incredibly successful whatever happens next. Their team cobbled together on unprotected draft picks have massively overachieved.</p>

            <p>They have that difference making reliable goalie, albeit an aging one, in three-time Stanley Cup champion Marc-André Fleury. They also have a plethora of ex-fringe players, like Deryk Engelland and William Karlsson, picked up in the expansion draft that have relished their second shot by posting career best numbers. They've thrived on being the underdogs with something to prove.</p>

            <p>Is this all sustainable? Who knows, the Knights are the only franchise in US sports history to be asked such a question in their first season. The only thing that's clear is that for Las Vegas, that long wait for a team to call their own has been more than worth it.</p>
